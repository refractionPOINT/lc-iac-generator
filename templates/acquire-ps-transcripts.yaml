# This template leverages File Integrity Monitoring to trigger events when a
# PowerShell transcript is modified. A D&R rule watches for this and triggers
# a sensor command to retrieve the transcript 60 seconds after the modification occurs.
# Acquired transcripts will be uploaded as artifacts and retained for 30 days.
# It is worth noting that PS Transcripts can sometimes appear outside of the file path pattern
# provided.
